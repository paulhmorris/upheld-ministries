The worship, the prayer, the fellowship in sisterhoodâ€¦ something I never knew I needed as much as I did and something that could fill my cup, and help me feel strong enough for my children again!

Upheld Ministries relieved every burden I had for 2 days, including the burden of self-care. You made sure my body and soul had everything I needed to just rest.",
